# Learn N Grow

Learn N Grow is supposedly a decentralized social media where anyone could share collectible content. Data is hosted on-chain and on the IPFS protocol, thanks to [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/), a decentralized storage service.

> Blockchain being an open and transparent technology no need to be in a whitelist whatsoever to register. The Dapp is also open to anyone and no need to have a profile to use it in read only mode.

* Checkout the contract on [Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x18DD042707d7ec2C5f0393271eE22A77E1A1AEcc)
* Checkout the DApp on [Vercel](https://learn-n-grow.vercel.app/feed)

## Features

The platform is rather simple, we can create a profile, which will generate an NFT owned by the address creating the profile.

Once the profile minted, you will be able to post content and comment on posts.
